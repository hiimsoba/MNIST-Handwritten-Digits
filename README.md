# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits
Simple program that uses Daniel Shiffman's Toy Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits. Using the MNIST dataset for training and testing the neural network.

The dataset was too large to upload, but you can grab it from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and drop it in a directory called "data" ( or just modify the code to load it from wherever you want ) and it shall work just fine.
